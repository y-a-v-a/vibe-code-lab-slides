I will be presenting some of my recent discoveries and experiences with AI-aided coding. I’ll be showing Claude Code, Codex, Aider, Cursor and some other new developments, and some findings around which models seem to work best.

I want to share this because I think the role of software engineer / developer will drastically change the coming years so it’s important to gain this knowledge soon. Please feel free to supply input, there’ll be some time for Q and A too, hopefully.
