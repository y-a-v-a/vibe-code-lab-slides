# Claude Code Community Event - Amsterdam

Join a Claude Code Community Event, organized by local Claude Code enthusiasts for everyone who loves building with Claude Code!

> **Notice**: this is an in-person only event in Amsterdam with no online streaming available.

## About the Event

Welcome to the first Claude Code Meetup in Amsterdam! We are excited to bring together the local Claude Code community for an evening focused on practical AI-assisted development.

This event is supported by Anthropic and organized by local Claude Code enthusiasts. Whether you are a developer exploring AI-powered coding workflows, a founder prototyping your next idea, a business professional looking to build custom tools, or simply curious about what Claude Code can do, this event is for you.

The evening will feature live demonstrations, practical insights from real-world projects, and a Q&A session with a member of the Anthropic team. You will have the chance to connect with fellow builders, ask questions, and learn from others who are already working with Claude Code.

While the focus is on coding and development, we welcome people from all disciplines. Technical background is helpful but not required. Curiosity is essential.

## Who Should Come

- Developers curious about AI-assisted workflows
- Founders who want to prototype ideas quickly
- Business owners looking to build custom tools without long development cycles
- Anyone who has said "we need to build something" but does not know where to start
- Experimenters and tinkerers who learn by doing
- People who prefer seeing demos over reading documentation

## Updates

### Claude Code meetup update
**Vincent Bruijn** - Dec 5, 10:16 AM

Hi everyone,

Thanks for signing up for the Claude Code meetup on December 11th. Three speakers and a Q&A with an Anthropic employee are awaiting you!

Quick note though: we now have a waitlist of 30+ people hoping to attend. If your plans have changed or you're unsure whether you can make it that evening, I'd really appreciate it if you could free up your spot so someone from the waitlist can join.

December is busy for everyone, so no hard feelings at all; just hit the unregister button if you need to.

Looking forward to seeing those of you who can make it!

Vincent
